# Zapper Phone

*More info coming soon...*

You didn't think the NES Zapper was just for shooting ducks, did you? I turned mine into a wireless phone.

I came up with this idea after doing two other projects â€” reproducing [Alexander Graham Bell's photophone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ86fkRRS5M) (the world's first wireless phone from 1880), then doing a deep dive into the [hardware of the NES Zapper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWvGYfH0B30). Both of these devices have a photosensor that is crucial to their operation. It plays very different roles in each case, but it gave me the idea (and requisite knowledge) to merge the technologies.
